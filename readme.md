# Branch OOP

## Objective

The "oop" branch was created with the purpose of transforming the previously developed code in the "main" branch, which followed a functional programming approach, into an object-oriented paradigm. The goal is to restructure the code using fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, such as the creation of classes, attributes, methods, encapsulation, generics type, inheritance of attributes, the use of decorators, and polymorphism.

## Key Changes

### 1. Class Creation
   - Introduction of classes as the main structure to organize and represent entities within the system.

### 2. Attributes and Methods
   - Definition of attributes to store data and methods to perform operations related to the classes.

### 3. Encapsulation
   - Utilization of encapsulation to control access to attributes, ensuring data integrity and promoting code modularity.

### 4. Generics Type
   - Implementation of generics type to allow the creation of classes and methods that can be used with different data types.

### 5. Inheritance of Attributes
   - Application of the inheritance concept to reuse attributes and methods from a base class in derived classes.

### 6. Decorator
   - Incorporation of decorators to add extra functionalities to methods or classes, providing greater flexibility and modularity.

### 7. Polymorphism
   - Introduction of polymorphism to allow objects from different classes to be treated uniformly, facilitating system extension and maintenance.
